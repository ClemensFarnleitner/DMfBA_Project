128019789,128019789,"Thanks TheFon.  With the Java/CVE-201200507 file quarantined, I downloaded and installed the current version of Java from java.com (version 8 333). I then attempted another initialization of h2o.  It indicated it was performing a one time install of h2o.jar as it did this morning before the malware was detected and quarantined.  I immediately scanned the downloaded version of h2o.jar, and I received the exact same malware quarantine notification again.  Thoughts?","Jun 1, 2022 at 23:08",,,,72468521

127861968,127861968,"Thanks. The more specific question here is: Can i use an already existing model from AutoML to create a stack/ metalearner model? If yes, then how?","May 25, 2022 at 12:15",,,,72377082
127871899,127871899,@PayalSengupta You can use models from AutoML just as base models but you can't use them as metalearner. Metalearner gets predictions of the base models as its input.,"May 25, 2022 at 19:06",,,,72377082
127872135,127872135,"The 
metalearner_algorithm
 param is an algorithm, not a trained model.  You train the metalearner as part of the StackedEnsemble training, so that's why you can't pass an already trained model to the

127392753,127392753,"I considered this as a possible solution as well, but was put off with the hope of another solution. However it seems like this is the only possible way to extract the feature contribution. I guess this isn't really considered as a clean way of doing so.  If it was up to you would you still prefer the EIF from h2o (with the benefit of possible better outlier detection due to removing the tree branching bias) over the IF from Sklearn which is able to extract shap values? Or is this fully depended on the intended result?","May 3, 2022 at 12:31",,,,72099329
127393080,127393080,"I can't give you ""unbiased"" answer - I work for h2o. But generally speaking I'd consider the size of the data (h2o should scale better) and also the importance of the information from SHAP. IIRC there is 
KernelExplainer

shap
 package that should work on any algorithm (but it is slower) but maybe that could be used as well on the Isolation Forest.","May 3, 2022 at 12:46",,,,72099329
