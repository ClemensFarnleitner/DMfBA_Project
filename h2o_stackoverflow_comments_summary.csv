139391547,139391547,"It is for regression. The problem with your solution, is you are loosing all the data for x3 in the training stage, and so the model will not perform as well as it could have.   Instead, I am looking for a way to group x1 and x3 together so that it trains them as the same, even thought their values aren't.",Oct 4 at 11:32,,,,79049681
139463667,139463667,Hi Adam. I still don't understand your problem well. Could you please explain your issue using a simple example with concrete data? Thanks!,Oct 16 at 9:11,,,,79049681
139285027,139285027,"Yes, the column names are the same. That's the reason why the error that I'm getting makes no sense to me. At first I thought that I had failed to convert some variable into an h2o frame, but that doesn't seem to be the case either.",Sep 17 at 20:27,,,,78995415
139285078,139285078,"I also thought that in the test set I might need the y variable as a placeholder (even though it isn't used), but I get the same results with or without it in x_df_new",Sep 17 at 20:34,,,,78995415
139032506,139032506,"Thanks for the response - I think using frequency to weigh the relative importance across the levels within a categorical predictor is reasonable; on the other hand, SHAP seems to work for only tree-based models and I'm curious if there are similar measures for GLMs.",Aug 11 at 0:57,,,,78854135
139043415,139043415,"In newer versions of H2O, SHAP works for all the models that are available in H2O’s AutoML (DeepLearning, DRF, GBM, GLM, StackedEnsemble, XGBoost). You just need to specify 
background_frame
.  SHAP works on tree-based models even without background frame because we can use the structure of the trees to efficiently estimate how each feature influences the prediction. But even for tree-based models it’s usually better to estimate SHAP with background frame since it contains the information about distributions of individual variables.",Aug 12 at 20:21,,,,78854135
139053710,139053710,Appreciated the feedback - do you know where I could find documentation regarding implementing SHAP on GLMs or non tree-based models in general?,Aug 14 at 5:21,,,,78854135
139061995,139061995,"Most of the papers that were used for implementing the SHAP should be in h2o’s documentation 
docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/…
 . You can also check the references from the PR that added the SHAP to H2O: 
github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/pull/15734
 (I’m lazy and I didn’t update the PR’s description so some of the issues there mentioned are already resolved). If you want specifically GLM SHAP then you can have a look at this paper: 
arxiv.org/abs/2006.16234
 and 
nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31384-3
 for the conversion from link space.",Aug 15 at 6:34,,,,78854135
139053756,139053756,Thanks - the idea of using standardized coefficients to measure variable importance makes sense to me as they are scale independent. What I'm struggling with is how to aggregate these coefficients so that I can have a single number for each predictor (given that each level within a categorical predictor has its own coefficient),Aug 14 at 5:31,,,,78862361
138315359,138315359,"Thank you! So if I dont want the predictions of bush_name to be specific (as in I want to be able to predict future bushes that havent been planted yet, vs retraining the model each time), then should I still convert bush_name into a factor?",May 9 at 17:02,,,,78453131
138320130,138320130,"For random forest you should probably remove the 
bush_name
 from training. But for, e.g., mixed-effects models (e.g., HGLM) you can use it to separate the influence of the individual bush and the other variables (you can see why it can be useful when you look at Simpson's paradox).  I would probably try to train it with and without 
bush_name
 and if the influence of having 
bush_name
 is big (in CV metrics), I would try to add some more information if possible, e.g., environmental factors - is the bush in the shade, is it more exposed to wind etc.",May 10 at 8:05,,,,78453131
138490543,138490543,If I do 'step_dummy(bush_name)' is this similar to the factorizing of the variable? Thank you,May 30 at 14:37,,,,78453131
137950531,137950531,"Eureka!! Thank you Darren, I spliced the dataframe to only use the first 10 rows and I got a result, you're awesome. (I couldn't post the csv because the data in sensitive)",Mar 30 at 16:42,,,,78248479
137927362,137927362,You are right. Launching h2o cluster manually resolved the randomness that I was facing. I was previously starting h2o within my code.,Mar 28 at 1:47,,,,78201658
137832323,137832323,"Ahhh thank you!  I don't quite follow the matrix algebra above, but I think what you're saying is it's possible to rotate an orthogonal pattern matrix (which the unrotated PCA is) without having the correlation matrix.  It looks like the GPArotation R package can do that with functions like promax() and bifactor(). Thanks again!",Mar 18 at 18:20,,,,78181801

136976650,136976650,Many thanks! Weirdly enough that only works if the the (binary) model is loaded (using h2o.load_model()) in the same sessions as it was saved. Otherwise I still get error mentioned in the openingpost. I will open a ticket.,"Dec 21, 2023 at 8:50",,,,77680312

136112479,136112479,"Before sending the data to the H2O model, ensure that your response column is a factor with three levels.
