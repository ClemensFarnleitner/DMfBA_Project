It was right there but strangely I didn't see the obvious: You need to have a cluster object and every node needs to be initialized. The future package doesn't have a function to return the cluster object nor the ability to initialize nodes properly with complex code, but the parallel package does.\n\n\nTo use the model parallelism for tidymodels and data parallelism for h2o and agua, you need to mix-up parallel, future, and doFuture packages. The parallel packages is used to detect cores, make a cluster, and then load-up and initialize every node. The future and doFuture packages are used to plan a future and register the for.each backend, which is required to enable model-parallelism in tidymodels.

What we're interested in is predicting the production of rotten blueberries on a specific bush, among harvest of all blueberries of the individual bushes.\n\n\nEach bush has an identifying name: \nbush_name\n, such as \n'bush001'\n, and we want predictions based on each individual bush. For example, I want to know if bush025 produced a rotten berry on 2/2/22.\n\n\nInputs are in a df with the following dummy structure for the sake of this example:\n\n\ntrain_data <- data.frame(date = c(\"2022-01-01\", \"2022-01-07\", \"2022-02-09\", \"2022-05-01\", \"2022-11-01\", \"2022-11-02\"),\n                   bush_name = c(\"bush001\", \"bush001\", \"bush001\", \"bush043\", \"bush043\", \"bush043\"),\n                   bugs = c(2, 0, 1, 0, 3, 1),\n                   has_rotten_berry = c(1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0),\n                   berry_count = c(12, 1, 7, 100, 14, 4),\n                   weather = c(1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 1))\n\n\n\nI've got a random forest model that I have set up with the following high level set up:\n\n\nlibrary(agua)\nlibrary(parsnip)\nlibrary(h2o)\n\nh2o.init(nthreads = -1)\n\nmodel_fit <- rand_forest(mtry = 10,  trees = 100) %>%\n  set_engine(\"h2o\") %>%\n  set_mode(\"classification\") %>%\n  fit(has_rotten_berry ~  .,\n      data = train_data) %>% \n  step_dummy(bush_name) %>%\n  step_zv(all_predictors()) %>%\n  step_normalize(all_predictors())\n\n\n\nI do get this message after training:\n\n\nWarning message:\nIn .h2o.processResponseWarnings(res) :\n  Dropping bad and constant columns: [bush_name].\n\n\n\nWhat I want to know is:\n\n\nWhen I try to then predict on new data in the trained model, it seems that I am only able to input new test data with the bush_names of bushes I already trained on. \nAm I correct in assuming this model is creating bush-specific predictions? And therefore would have to input new bush information in the training in order to output a future prediction for those new bushes?\n\n\nExample: I plant a new bush, bush700, and it was not present in the original training data set. If I try to predict with the new bush data without it being present in the training data, is giving me a message that there are new levels in the data. So \nI'm assuming that because it seems these predictions are bush-specific, and we can't get any new bush predictions for newly-added bushes.\n\n\nIs this correct to assume?",

But maybe your data cannot be given, or there is too much of it.\n\n\nSo I'd suggest try just using the first/half second half of data, and if only one or the other trigger it then keep repeating, to see if you can narrow it down to just one row.\n\n\nAnd the same for columns, e.g. try 10-15 columns at a time, to see if it is just one column, or maybe certain types of column, triggering it.\n\n\nOf course, once you have that, you also have the solution: exclude the troublesome column/row.\nBut you will also have enough to give a bug report to H2O (looks like this can be done at \nhttps://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/issues\n)",
